In people who have an allergy, anaphylaxis can occur minutes after exposure to a specific allergy-causing substance (allergen). In some cases, there may be a delayed reaction, or anaphylaxis may occur without an obvious trigger.",

This is usually done by pressing the autoinjector against the person's thigh.\nHave the person lie face up and be still.\nLoosen tight clothing and cover the person with a blanket. Don't give the person anything to drink.\nIf there's vomiting or bleeding from the mouth, turn the person to the side to prevent choking.\nIf there are no signs of breathing, coughing or movement, begin CPR.

  "immediate_actions": "If a blister isn't too painful, try to keep it intact. Unbroken skin over a blister may provide a natural barrier to bacteria and decreases the risk of infection. Cover it with a bandage or moleskin. Cut a piece of moleskin into a doughnut shape and place the pad so that it encircles and protects the blister. Then cover the blister and moleskin with gauze.\n\nSeek medical care if the blister looks infected. If you have diabetes or poor circulation, call your doctor before treating the blister yourself.",
  "symptoms": "Blister",
  "common_triggers": "You can get blisters in several different ways, including some diseases. The most common types of blisters include:\n\nBlood blisters: You can get blood blisters when something pinches your skin. Instead of clear liquid, blood floods the area from broken blood vessels and damage to the lower layers of the skin. The blood pools and forms a blister.\nFriction blisters: Caused by rubbing on the skin, friction blisters form when clear fluid builds up in the upper layers of skin. Many people get friction blisters from walking too much in poor-fitting shoes or by not wearing socks. You can also get them on your hands from holding things like shovels or other tools.\nHeat blisters: You can get these blisters from burns or sunburns. They may also form after you warm up from frostbite. Blistering skin is part of a second-degree burn.",
  "treatment_and_aftercare": "To relieve blister-related pain, drain the fluid while leaving the overlying skin intact. Here's how:\n\nWash your hands and the blister with soap and warm water.\nSwab the blister with iodine.\nClean a sharp needle with rubbing alcohol.\nUse the needle to prick the blister in several spots near the edge. Let the fluid drain, but leave the overlying skin in place.\nApply an ointment such as petroleum jelly to the blister and cover it with a nonstick gauze bandage. If a rash appears, stop using the ointment.\nFollow-up care. Check the area every day for infection. After several days, use a tweezers and scissors sterilized with rubbing alcohol to cut away the dead skin. Apply more ointment and a bandage.",
  "prevention_and_preparedness": "To prevent friction blisters on your feet, wear shoes that fit well. It also helps to use moisture-wicking socks. Try the various socks, shoes and insoles that are designed specifically to help reduce blistering. You might also try attaching moleskin to the inside of your shoes where it might rub. Or you can dust the inside of your socks with foot powder. Gloves help prevent blisters on your hands."

Loosely cover the area with gauze or a clean cloth.\nRaise the burned area. Lift the wound above heart level if possible.\nWatch for signs of shock. Signs and symptoms include cool, clammy skin, weak pulse and shallow breathing.\nTreating minor burns\nFor minor burns:\n\nCool the burn. Hold the area under cool (not cold) running water for about 10 minutes. If the burn is on the face, apply a cool, wet cloth until the pain eases. For a mouth burn from hot food or drink, put a piece of ice in the mouth for a few minutes.\nRemove rings or other tight items from the burned area. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the area swells.\nDon't break blisters. Blisters help protect against infection. If a blister does break, gently clean the area with water and apply an antibiotic ointment.\nApply lotion. After the burn is cooled, apply a lotion, such as one with aloe vera or cocoa butter. This helps prevent drying and provides relief.\nBandage the burn. Cover the burn with a clean bandage. Wrap it loosely to avoid putting pressure on burned skin.

    "term": "Chest Pain",
    "overview": "First aid for chest pain depends on the cause. Causes of chest pain can vary. Serious health conditions such as a heart attack or blood clot in the lungs can cause chest pain. Other causes of chest pain include heartburn, pulled muscles and emotional stress.\n\nIt can be difficult to tell if chest pain is due to a heart attack or other health condition, especially if you've never had chest pain before. Don't try to diagnose the cause yourself. Get emergency medical help if you have unexplained chest pain that lasts more than a few minutes.\n\nHeart attack\nA heart attack generally causes chest pain for more than 15 minutes. The pain may be mild or severe. Some heart attacks happen suddenly. But sometimes warning symptoms happen hours or days in advance.\n\nAngina\nAngina is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It's relatively common. But it can be hard to tell it apart from other types of chest pain, such as indigestion.\n\nPulmonary embolism\nPulmonary embolism is a blood clot in the lung. It happens when a clot, usually in the leg or pelvis, breaks free and gets stuck in a lung artery. The clot blocks or reduces blood flow. This makes it harder for the lungs to send oxygen to the rest of the body.\n\nAortic dissection\nAn aortic dissection is a tear in the inner layer of the body's main artery, called the aorta. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that needs emergency medical treatment.\n\nPneumonia with pleurisy\nPneumonia is an infection of the air sacs in the lungs. Symptoms include chest pain, chills, fever, and a cough that may produce bloody or foul-smelling sputum. Pleurisy is inflammation of the tissues that surround the lung. It can cause chest pain when taking a breath or coughing.\n\nUnlike a true heart attack, pleurisy pain is usually relieved temporarily by holding your breath or putting pressure on the painful area of your chest.\n\nIf you've recently been diagnosed with pneumonia and have symptoms of pleurisy, see a healthcare professional. Pleurisy alone isn't a medical emergency, but you shouldn't try to make the diagnosis yourself.\n\nPericarditis\nPericarditis is swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding your heart. It causes sharp chest pain. The chest pain gets worse when you cough, lie down or take a deep breath.\n\nPericarditis is usually mild and goes away without treatment. If it's severe, you may need medicine or, rarely, surgery.\n\nIt may be hard to tell the difference between sudden pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack. If you have sudden, unexplained chest pain, seek emergency medical help.\n\nChest wall pain\nChest wall pain is a type of muscle pain. Bruised chest muscles may happen from excessive coughing, straining or a minor injury.\n\nOne type of chest wall pain is costochondritis. Costochondritis causes pain and tenderness in and around the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone.\n\nIf you have costochondritis, pressing on a few points along the edge of your breastbone often triggers considerable tenderness. If gently touching the area with your fingers causes chest pain, it's unlikely that a serious condition, such as a heart attack, is the cause.",
    "immediate_actions": "If you or someone else may be having a heart attack, follow these first-aid steps:\nCall 911 or emergency medical help. Don't ignore the symptoms of a heart attack. If an ambulance or emergency vehicle can't come to you, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only if there are no other options.\nTake aspirin, if recommended. Aspirin helps prevent blood clotting. Taking aspirin during a heart attack may reduce heart damage. Don't take an aspirin unless a healthcare professional says to do so. Don't delay calling 911 to take an aspirin. Call for emergency help first.\nTake nitroglycerin, if prescribed. If you think you're having a heart attack and your healthcare professional has previously prescribed nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed. Don't take anyone else's nitroglycerin.\nStart CPR if the person doesn't have a pulse or isn't breathing. If you're untrained in CPR, do hands-only CPR. That means push hard and fast on the person's chest about 100 to 120 times a minute. If you're trained in CPR and confident in your ability, start with 30 chest compressions before giving two rescue breaths.\nUse an automated external defibrillator (AED) if one is immediately available and the person is unconscious. The device sends shocks to the heart to reset the heart rhythm. AEDs come with step-by-step voice instructions for their use. They only give a shock when appropriate.",
    "symptoms": "Heart attack:\nChest pain that may feel like pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing or aching.\nPain or discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth or sometimes the upper belly.\nCold sweat.\nFatigue.\nHeartburn or indigestion.\nLightheadedness or sudden dizziness.\nNausea.\nShortness of breath.\n\nAngina:\nAngina may feel like squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. It can be stable or unstable.\n\nStable angina usually happens during activity and goes away with rest or angina medicine. The pain is predictable and usually similar to previous bouts of chest pain. The chest pain typically lasts a short time, perhaps five minutes or less.\nUnstable angina is unpredictable and occurs at rest. Or the angina pain is worsening and occurs with less activity. It doesn't go away with rest or the medicine. Unstable angina is dangerous and needs emergency treatment. It may be a sign of a future heart attack.\n\nPulmonary embolism:\nSymptoms of pulmonary embolism may include:\n\nSudden, sharp chest pain often with shortness of breath.\nSudden, unexplained shortness of breath, even without pain.\nCough that may produce blood-streaked spit.\nRapid heartbeat with shortness of breath.\nFainting.\nSevere anxiety.\nUnexplained sweating.\nSwelling of one leg only, caused by a blood clot in the leg.\n\nAortic dissection:\nSudden severe chest or upper back pain, often described as a tearing or ripping sensation, that spreads to the neck or down the back.\nSudden severe stomach pain.\nLoss of consciousness.\nShortness of breath.\nStroke symptoms such as sudden vision problems, difficulty speaking, and weakness or loss of movement on one side of your body.\nWeak pulse in one arm or thigh compared with the other.\nLeg pain.\nDifficulty walking.",

Seek medical help if the bleeding does not stop.\nWhen to contact your doctor\nCall a member of your care team if:\n\nYou have nosebleeds often. You may need to have a blood vessel cauterized. Cautery is a method that burns and seals blood vessels using electric current, silver nitrate or a laser. Also, a care provider might pack the nose with special gauze or an inflatable latex balloon. Both packing methods put pressure on the blood vessel and stop the bleeding.\nYou have nosebleeds and you're taking blood thinners. If you're taking medicines such as aspirin or warfarin (Jantoven), your care team may change the medicine dose.",

The small, flat batteries used in watches and other electronics — particularly the larger, nickel-sized ones — are especially dangerous to small children. A battery stuck in the esophagus can cause severe tissue burns.\n\nIf you suspect that a child has swallowed one of these batteries, immediately take him or her for an emergency X-ray to determine its location. If the battery is in the esophagus, it will have to be removed. If it has passed into the stomach, it's usually safe to allow it to pass on through the intestinal tract.\n\nMedicated patches.
